      <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
      <p>
        I am an accomplished helicopter pilot seeking new challenges. Over the
        past two years my curiosity has turned my hobby into a career path. Iâ€™ve
        decided to pursue a field which plays to my strengths of being a
        creative, driven problem solver. What I pride myself most is my ability
        learn, and to know more today than I did yesterday.
